Runfile
    The requested file showing how to run the program from the command
    line (without the required argument)
    
RunfileEnhanced
    This file was not requested, but it shows how to run the program
    TokenizerTestEnhanced from the command line (without the required argument)
    
runfilebased.sh
    A shell script, based on the contents of a runfile and a data folder both
    given as arguments, enabling the running of many tests of a test driver
    as the result of issuing just one command.
    
runfilebased-description.txt
    A description of the shell script mentioned above.
    
testRunfile.sh
    A shell script, based on the contents of Runfile and folder data, enabling
    the running of many tests of the test driver as the result of issuing
    just one command with no arguments.
    
testRunfileEnhanced.sh
    A shell script, based on the contents of RunfileEnhanced and folder
    dataEnhanced, enabling the running of many tests of the test driver
    as the result of issuing just one command with no arguments.
    
runbothsets.sh
    A shell script that tests both TokenizerTest and TokenizerTestEnhanced.

runwith.sh
    A shell script that runs what is given in Runfile on the one data
    file that the user gives as the one argument to this script.
    
runenhancedwith.sh
    A shell script that runs what is given in RunfileEnhanced on the one data
    file that the user gives as the one argument to this script.
    
testscript.sh
    A shell script enabling the running of many tests of the test driver
    as the result of issuing just one command; the command is given as
    an argument, so this script is independent of any runfile.
    
testscript-description.txt
    A description of the shell script mentioned above.
    
src/edu/c3341/Tokenizer.java
    The Tokenizer interface (Java source)
src/edu/c3341/TokenKind.java
    TokenKind enum for a "subset" of the Core language tokens (Java source)
src/edu/c3341/Tokenizer1.java
    Tokenizer1 class implementing Tokenizer for a "subset" of the Core
    language tokens (Java source)
src/edu/c3341/TokenizerTest.java
    The test driver for Tokenizer that behaves as requested by Part 1
src/edu/c3341/TokenizerTestEnhanced.java
    An enhanced test driver that shows identifier names and integer values;
    it also concludes with the end-of-file token, 33.

test/TokenizerTestDriverTest.java
    A JUnit test fixture for testing TokenizerTest.

test/TokenizerTestDriverEnhcancedTest.java
    A JUnit test fixture for testing TokenizerTestEnhcanced.
    
Both of the test fixtures above rely on the test runner being single-threaded.

Instructions to Grader

The zip file is an archived Eclipse project.  If you wish, you may
import it into Eclipse and use Run Configurations to run it from
there.

Alternatively, you can run the test driver from within the project's root
directory. For example, I have run a test using the following command at
a stdlinux terminal command prompt:

java -cp ./bin edu/c3341/TokenizerTest ./data/test01

Of course, you may wish first to compile this program yourself to assure
that the class files are indeed coming from the java source files. With
the project's root directory as your current directory, issue the following
command to replace the class files in the bin directory:

javac -d bin src/edu/c3341/*.java
