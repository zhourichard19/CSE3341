This (runfilebased.sh) is a very hacky script that reads the files that do not contain "output" from a folder and, for each one of those files runs a diff between a command from a given Runfile and the unix conversion of the file that has the name: filename+expected-output. It feels fragile and poor, but it does run all 12 files and compares the difference in a single run.

To successfully run runfilebased.sh, you may need to issue the following command
to establish execute permission for that file:

chmod u+x runfilebased.sh 

Here are the results of a single run:
zaccai@zaccai-HP:~/eclipse-workspace/CoreInterpreterPart1ShrtPkg$ ./runfilebased.sh Runfile data 
Running command: java -cp ./bin edu/c3341/TokenizerTest
With files in folder: data

I modified the expected answer for file test01 so that there was an error. There is plenty of room for improvement, such as:
•	flags for verbose output of each students answer
•	using the output of diff to provide a success report vs an error log (it would be nicer)
•	using tr to modify the student output so that any white-space becomes a new line (to prevent errors with hard-coded new-lines and/or tabs)
But, it is a start.
